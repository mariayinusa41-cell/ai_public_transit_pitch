# AI‑Powered Public Transit Concept

This repository contains a conceptual analysis and prototype code for an AI‑driven public transportation system that combines on‑demand pod‑based pickup services with high‑speed rail or subway infrastructure.  The goal is to reduce average commute times by approximately 30 percent through intelligent routing, dynamic scheduling and integration of different transit modes.

## Concept Overview

Recent advances in transportation engineering envision ultra‑fast pod‑based transit systems that operate in low‑pressure tunnels or dedicated lanes.  Coupled with AI‑driven demand forecasting and routing, such systems could drastically reduce travel times compared to traditional public transit.

This project explores the potential of combining:

- **Autonomous pod vehicles** for first‑mile/last‑mile pickup and delivery.
- **High‑speed rail or subway segments** for rapid intercity or intra‑city travel.
- **AI algorithms** for route optimization and fleet management.

## Data & Prototype

A synthetic dataset (`data/sample_transit_data.csv`) is provided to simulate commuter origin–destination pairs, current average commute times (in minutes) and daily commuter volumes.  The prototype script (`analysis.py`) reads this dataset, calculates total commute time and models the impact of reducing travel times by 30 percent.  It also produces a bar chart comparing current and projected commute times.

You can replace the sample dataset with real transit data to conduct a more realistic analysis.

## Requirements

Install the required Python packages:

```
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

Run the analysis script:

```
python analysis.py
```

The script will:

1. Load the sample dataset.
2. Compute the current total travel time and average commute time.
3. Apply a 30 percent reduction to commute times to simulate the AI‑powered system.
4. Print the before‑and‑after summary to the console.
5. Generate a bar chart comparing average commute times (saved to `results`).

## Next Steps

This repository is a starting point for a more comprehensive project.  Potential future enhancements include:

- Integrating real transit data from public agencies.
- Implementing machine learning models to forecast demand and optimize routing.
- Simulating passenger routing to evaluate system performance under various scenarios.
- Designing a user‑friendly interface to visualize and interact with the data.

## Acknowledgements

This concept draws inspiration from emerging transportation technologies such as Hyperloop, which proposes pod‑based vehicles traveling at high speeds through low‑pressure tubes, potentially cutting travel times dramatically.
